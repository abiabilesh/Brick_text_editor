# BRICK TEXT EDITOR
This repository is meant for a linux based command line text editor named "BRICK TEXT EDITOR"
***
**NOTE:** Since the project is an open repository and us as a bunch of noobies trying to crack this project. Any one is welcome to contribute!!

**As of May 2020, the text editor is capable of reading just a single file and partially editable despite the fact that it cannot save.**
***
Brick text editor is planned to become a more or less the same conventional text editor as you see in the linux world!!! Just like the ever
famous vim and its families. But on the go, some changes are planned to make this Brick a unique and a cross platform tool with colorful and efficient ideas.
